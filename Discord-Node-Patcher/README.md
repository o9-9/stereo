## 🆕 What's New in v4.0

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **February 2026 Build Support** | All 15 offsets updated for the Feb 9, 2026 discord_voice.node |
| **Binary Validation** | Pre-patch byte probes across 3 code sections detect wrong builds and already-patched files before writing |
| **Bounds-Checked Patching** | Every patch write validates offset + length against file size — no more silent corruption on mismatched builds |
| **Dynamic HighPassFilter** | Stub address computed from `IMAGE_BASE + HighpassCutoffFilter` at compile time instead of hardcoded bytes |
| **Anti-Downgrade Protection** | Auto-updater compares version numbers and refuses to replace a newer script with an older one |

### GUI Features

- **Client Dropdown** — Auto-detects all installed Discord variants
- **Gain Slider** — Adjust volume from 1x to 10x
- **Auto-Relaunch** — Automatically restart Discord after patching (enabled by default)
- **Patch All** — Fix every client with one click

### Command Line

```powershell
.\script.ps1                      # Open GUI
.\script.ps1 -FixAll              # Patch all clients (no GUI)
.\script.ps1 -FixClient "Canary"  # Patch specific client

.\script.ps1 -SkipUpdateCheck     # Skip auto-update check
```

### Gain Guide

| Level | Use Case | Safety |
|:-----:|----------|:------:|
| 1-2x | Normal use | ✅ Safe |
| 3-4x | Quiet sources | ⚠️ Caution |
| 5-10x | Maximum boost | ❌ May distort |

### File Locations

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `%TEMP%\DiscordVoicePatcher\` | Logs, config, compiled patcher |
| `%TEMP%\DiscordVoicePatcher\Backups\` | Auto-backups (max 10) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>🔧 Troubleshooting</h2></summary>

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No compiler found" | Install Visual Studio with C++ workload |
| "Discord not found" | Make sure Discord is running |
| "Access denied" | Script auto-elevates, just accept the prompt |
| Audio distorted | Lower gain to 1-2x |
| No effect after patch | Restart Discord completely |
| "Binary validation failed" | Your discord_voice.node doesn't match the Feb 2026 build — wait for a patcher update or restore from backup |

### View Logs
```powershell
notepad "$env:TEMP\DiscordVoicePatcher\patcher.log"
```

### Restore Original
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProdHallow/Discord-Node-Patcher-Feb-9-2026/main/Discord_voice_node_patcher.ps1 | iex

### v4.0 (Current) — February 2026 Build
- 🚀 **NEW:** All 15 offsets updated for Feb 9, 2026 discord_voice.node build
- 🚀 **NEW:** Pre-patch binary validation — checks original bytes at 3 sites across different PE sections before writing anything
- 🚀 **NEW:** Already-patched detection — recognizes patched signatures and re-applies safely (e.g. for gain changes)
- 🚀 **NEW:** Bounds-checked `PatchBytes` — every write validates `offset + length ≤ fileSize` and aborts on overflow
- 🚀 **NEW:** File size gate (12–18 MB) rejects obviously wrong binaries before any patches are attempted
- 🚀 **NEW:** Dynamic HighPassFilter stub — `mov rax, IMAGE_BASE + HighpassCutoffFilter; ret` computed at compile time from offset constants, no more hardcoded byte strings
- 🛡️ **SECURITY:** Auto-updater now compares `[version]` objects and refuses downgrades (prevents v4.0 → v3.1 regression from stale remote)
- 🔀 **CHANGED:** Repository moved to [Discord-Node-Patcher-Feb-9-2026](https://github.com/ProdHallow/Discord-Node-Patcher-Feb-9-2026)
- 🔀 **CHANGED:** Voice backup files hosted in new repo's `discord_voice/` directory
- 🛠️ **FIXED:** `char` signedness — HighPassFilter stub uses `unsigned char` array instead of signed `char` casts

### v3.1 — Bugfix Release
- 🐛 **FIXED:** Mod clients (BetterDiscord, Vencord, Equicord, BetterVencord) showing "This client is not installed" when they share the same install path as Discord Stable
- 🐛 **FIXED:** C++ generated code missing `Process32First` call — could silently skip the first process in the snapshot
- 🐛 **FIXED:** MSVC compilation could deadlock when reading stdout/stderr; now redirects to log file with 120-second timeout
- 🐛 **FIXED:** MSVC build path parsing broken for usernames containing spaces
- 🐛 **FIXED:** `$args` variable shadowing in MinGW/Clang compilation
- 🐛 **FIXED:** `-SkipUpdateCheck` flag not passed through during auto-elevation
- ✨ Added `DetectPath` for mod clients — checks for mod-specific folders (e.g. `%APPDATA%\BetterDiscord`) before listing as installed
- ✨ Added config file validation for out-of-range gain values
- ✨ Added `Cleanup-TempFiles` — removes compiler artifacts after patching
- 🧹 Removed comment blocks; replaced `#region`/`#endregion` with numbered section headers

### v3.0 — Major Release
- 🚀 **NEW:** Automatic voice module replacement from GitHub
- 🚀 **NEW:** Auto-relaunch checkbox — automatically restart Discord after patching
- 🐛 **FIXED:** Gain slider now responds to all input types (click, drag, keyboard)
- 🐛 **FIXED:** Replaced minified C++ code with clean original code (fixes Discord crash on voice join)
- ⚠️ **Breaking Change:** Patches are now applied to known-compatible module files rather than arbitrary Discord versions

### v2.6.2
- 🐛 Fixed MSVC compilation error ("Cannot open source file")
- ✨ Added auto-update system
- ✨ Added BAT launcher

### v2.6.1
- 🐛 Fixed empty string parameter error
- 🐛 Fixed array handling issues
- 🐛 Fixed GUI variable scoping

### v2.6.0
- ✨ Multi-client detection (9 Discord variants)
- ✨ "Patch All" button
- ✨ CLI batch mode (`-FixAll`, `-FixClient`)

### v2.5
- ✨ Disk-based detection (no voice channel needed)
- ✨ Auto-elevation

### How It Works (v4.0)

1. Downloads compatible voice module files from GitHub backup repository
2. Closes Discord processes
3. Backs up existing voice module (for rollback)
4. Replaces voice module files with compatible versions
5. **Validates binary** — checks original bytes at 3 code sections to confirm correct build
6. PowerShell generates C++ patcher code with your settings
7. Compiles to an executable using your C++ compiler
8. Applies **bounds-checked** binary patches at specific memory offsets
9. Cleans up temporary compiler artifacts
10. Optionally relaunches Discord

### What Gets Patched

| Component | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| Stereo | Disables mono downmix |
| Bitrate | Removes 64kbps cap → 382kbps |
| Sample Rate | Bypasses 24kHz limit → 48kHz |
| Audio Processing | Replaces filters with gain control |
| Error Handler | Disabled to prevent patch-related throws |

### Offset Table (Feb 9, 2026 Build)

```
0x53840B  EmulateStereoSuccess1   → 02
0x538417  EmulateStereoSuccess2   → EB (JMP)
0x118C41  CreateAudioFrameStereo  → 49 89 C5 90
0x3A7374  OpusConfigChannels      → 02
0x53886A  BitrateModified         → F0 D4 05 (382kbps)
0x538573  Emulate48Khz            → 90 90 90
0x544680  HighPassFilter          → mov rax, <HPC VA>; ret
0x8BD4C0  HighpassCutoffFilter    → injected hp_cutoff()
0x8BD6A0  DcReject                → injected dc_reject()
0x8B9830  DownmixFunc             → C3 (ret)
0x3A7610  ConfigIsOk              → return 1
0x2C0040  ThrowError              → C3 (ret)
```

### Safety Features (New in v4.0)

| Check | What It Catches |
|-------|----------------|
| File size gate (12–18 MB) | Completely wrong file type |
| Pre-patch byte probes (3 sections) | Wrong build / wrong Discord version |
| Already-patched detection | Re-patching safely for gain changes |
| Per-write bounds check | Offset overflow from build mismatch |
| Version-aware auto-update | Prevents downgrade to older offsets |
